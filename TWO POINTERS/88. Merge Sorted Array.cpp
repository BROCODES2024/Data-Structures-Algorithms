We are going to use two pointers (technically, three pointers). approach, but a bit different,
We will start from the last element of both arrays if the element of the second array

If the last element of the second array is less than the first, then nums1[k]=nums1[i] and then k--,i--

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
i = 0, j = -1, k = 0: The loop condition is false because j is not greater than or equal to 0. The loop exits.
The merged nums1 array after this process is still [1], which is the expected output.
